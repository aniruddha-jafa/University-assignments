:: Assumptions

o) Have only used regexes - no edit distance. So the chatbot is easy to fool if one wants to.

i) 5 classes of statement

balance query
payment query
outstanding
ambiguous statement, but contains terms that might warrant a re-phrase 
all other statements: “Sorry but I cannot help you..”


ii) Account number is 10-digits

iii) Credit card number is 16 digits

iv)* Does not take date into account (Questions like “when should I pay my credit card bill” are treated as normal payment queries)

v)* “How much money do I owe" - is ambiguous (payment or outstanding), so we ask the user to rephrase.

vi) 
“payment due”, “total due” -  treated as card payment queries


:: How to run code

Just enter “python file_name” on the terminal, and follow on-screen instructions 


:: Collaborators
Paul Kurian suggested the is_likely_ambiguous_statement() function to recall sessions in case of ambiguous statements.
